### Push Mechanics - Zombie Knockdown

You may knock zombies down with your base melee attack. For about 2 seconds, their collisions are off and you may run by them. This attack still deals some damage, but your knife is in your equipment slot if you would like to use it. Knife does greatly improved damage. See an example below.

![Zombie_Punch](https://github.com/jhw2167/BO1-Reimagined-expanded/assets/54991158/8a622ad0-dc7f-4992-964b-86a99ecefb08)

&nbsp;

  ![BabyJuggDemo](https://github.com/jhw2167/BO1-Reimagined-expanded/assets/54991158/b25c4305-8d45-4b60-8770-6ea576836b17)

### Zombie Health and Weapon Balance Changes

  You may view the expected zombie health value per round and expected number of bullets to kill by weapon class [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LdMHwtOZKg7aRkDjs8t1waXxXBAzW58_5yTC6NoLz_c/edit#gid=0). The current Max Zombie Health is **200,000** and is reached on round 46, subject to change.

### Shotgun Changes

  Shotguns have much improved base damage (see above) and receive a damage bonus from "attrition". For each round you own a shotgun, you do 10% more damage with all shotguns, this stacks up to 15 rounds for a maximum of 4x base damage. Moreover, upgraded shotguns will knock zombies over if they do sufficient damage but don't kill the zombie.  See an example below.

![Shotguns](https://github.com/jhw2167/BO1-Reimagined-expanded/assets/54991158/17d0f2a0-5cfc-452d-acc7-2a52da819ff9)


### Customizable Game Settings

  Most features added in Reimagined-Expanded will be toggle-able in the settings so you can opt for a more vanilla experience if you wish.
  
![Options](https://github.com/jhw2167/BO1-Reimagined-expanded/assets/54991158/f67f9e6b-c7af-44b1-8e10-84e0fcf6d560)


## Apocalypse Mode

  Apocalypse Mode offers a serious challenge even for hardcore zombies players. The zombies run very early and hit you very quickly. Points from shooting zombies are limited and most of the Reimagined-Expanded bonues (Perkapunch, Double PaP) are more expensive than on normal difficulty. Zombies spawn very quickly, super-sprinters are on every map, and some zombies will run even faster. Zombie bosses will spawn more frequently and zombies that go undamaged for a period of time will despawn and spawn again at full health.

  Some other changes include: (**Not Implemented with Alpha Release**)
  - Zombies will spawn with special abilities and resistances designated by their eye color (more health, resistance to explosives)
  - Zombies will occaisionally spawn in mini hordes of 3-5 zombies all from the same spawn location
  - Alternative bosess will be added to each map
  - Zombie "chase" algorithm will be modified to make training more difficult

<summary><b>FAQ</b></summary>

Youtube Guide [here](https://youtu.be/2_kCFR6lkO8). 

*Q. I want to play this mod, but I don't have Black Ops, can I?.*
- No. You need an official copy of Call of Duty Black Ops (probably from Steam). The best deals I see for Black Ops these days are about $45 for the Game + DLC. That is expensive for a 13 year old game. If you see it for cheaper let me know, be careful with cheaper copies of the game that may not be legitimate.

*Q. Can I play this mod on a console?.*
- No. There is no support for mods on console editions of COD, as far as I am concerned.

*Q. My Black Ops doesn't start. The symbol on the task bar loads, but the game doesn't seem to load.*
- Sometimes this happens because you are starting the game in fullscreen mode (or windowed) and your computer doesn't like that. Navigate to "Call of Duty Black Ops"/players/mods/Reimagined-Expanded repo and open the config.cfg file with notepad. search for "fullscreen" and switch the setting to "1" or "0", whichever is not currently working.

*Q. I can load the game, but I don't think the mod is working. Help me.*
-  The only way the mod works is if you run it via the "Reimagined-Expanded.bat" file that loads the mod via game_mod. When you load the game, go to your "Game" settings and see if you have Reimagined-Expanded Game options at the bottom. When you load into a zombies game, you should have a healthbar and your melee attack should be a punch.

*Q. The mod works, but all my textures are weird and black and messed up.*
- Make sure you download **BOTH** the Multiplayer Black Ops and the "Blue" single player/zombies Black Ops.  You never need to run the "multiplayer" Black Ops, but you do need to have it downloaded.  I have also heard the "Shader Warming" graphics setting may affect this.

*Q. When I start the game and try to play zombies, a window pops up that says "Connecting" then the game tells me it can't connect to Black Ops servers, whats the problem?*
- This happens often. You should restart the game when this happens and keep trying until it lets you go into the zombies mode. If you are just playing solo, you can swap to my provided "dev_config".cfg file in players/mods/Reimagined-Expanded folder which will map the map start console commands to your F keys (F1-F10). Then you can start a zombies match on solo whenever you want.

*Q. When I try to play with my friend, the loading screen stalls at "Waiting for players.*
- This can happen if you do not have the same exact mod version as your friend. Use the updater to make sure you have the most recent version. You also may need to port forward or change your NAT type (ask Chat GPT for help).

Reach out to me on my discord if you encounter other errors or need additional help.
