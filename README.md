#### Upgradable Perks

#### Push Mechanics - Zombie Knockdown

You may knock zombies down with your base melee attack. For about 2 seconds, their collisions are off and you may run by them. This attack still does some damage, but your knife is in your equipment
slot if you would like to use it. See an example below.
